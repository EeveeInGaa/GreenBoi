# Daily Log Bot ðŸ‘¾

This GitHub Actions workflow automatically updates `log.md` with the current date and time every day.

- Random number of commits (1â€“10)
- 10% chance to skip the day
- Random delay before each commit (5-25 sec)
- Fully automated once set up

This project is for fun and learning how automations and GitHub Actions work.
